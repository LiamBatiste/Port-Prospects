# Port-Prospects
An analytical approach to identifying potential opportunities for marketing Wärtsilä’s advanced propulsion solutions tailored towards defence, tankers and cargo vessels through market segmentation. 
These vessel types have been chosen as they are the target market often sought out by Wärtsilä.


### Areas for Potential Enhancement:

**Operational Efficiency Analysis:**  
Beyond just identifying the lowest performers, it could be beneficial to evaluate operational metrics such as fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and lifecycle costs for different engine types. This can help articulate the value proposition of Wärtsilä's solutions more effectively.

**Competitor Analysis:**  
While my focus was on identifying opportunities for Wärtsilä, understanding the competitive landscape—who the main competitors are in these segments and what they offer—could provide valuable context towards these findings.

**Customer Segmentation:**  
Analysing potential customers based on the identified vessel data (e.g., government contracts, shipping companies) could refine the marketing strategies and allow for a greater focus on specific target markets.

**Integration of External Data:**  
If feasible, I should consider integrating external datasets, such as industry reports or economic indicators, to enrich your analysis and support your findings.
